**Overview:**
Socket programming is a fundamental concept in computer networking that enables communication between devices over a network. It forms the basis for creating various network applications, including client-server applications. A client-server application is a software architecture in which one program (the server) provides services or resources to other programs (clients) over a network.


**Client-Server Architecture:**
In a client-server architecture, the server program typically listens for incoming client requests, processes those requests, and provides responses or services accordingly. Clients initiate communication with the server, request specific actions or data, and receive responses. This architecture is widely used in applications like web servers, email servers, chat applications, and more.
